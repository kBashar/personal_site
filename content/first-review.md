An America that is fighting now with the monster within, a monster that wants to undone the civil liberty achieved through decades of struggle, is let to recollect once again the greatest achievement, landing man on the moon, in the movie “Hidden Figures” but this time to celebrate the figures those were marginalized then and kept behind the curtain until now. “Hidden figures” embarks on to shed light on the widespread racialism in the USA in 1960s contemporary by rolling its lense inside the NASA when it was enjoying nationwide reverberation for its effort to put man in the space and thus taking the American identity to a new height.

Exactly 100 years had passed after the American Civil war in 1861, the USA is competing in another war, this time an external belligerent, USSR, to instate its supremacy in space. Day and night, man and women were working at NASA to make good on the promise the politicians made to their constituencies and to the world. A nation about to fly to the moon yet its “soul” crippled by the segregation, maintaining separate provisions for whites and blacks, even at the NASA. 

Black women were designated as “colored computer” who were to verify as well as do the cumbersome calculations for the engineers. Among them three prodigious women who are friends themselves as well are the protagonists of the cinema. We see the repressed lives of blacks in America through the eyes of and with Katherine Johnson, Dorothy Vaughan and Mary Jackson employed as colored computers at NASA and later climbing the ladder on their own credit. 

Watching blatant and omnipresent maltreatment of a part of the society by another is nauseating still continuous comical reliefs accompanied by soothing music helps us to remain sane and entertained. This Biographical Drama film will reinvigorate the inspiration of equalities in the American societies which has kept it great all through the 20th century, as well will help, I hope, the USA in search of its lost rigours of “greatness” to “make America great again”.
